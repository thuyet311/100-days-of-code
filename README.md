### Day 0
I initially planned to pursue Natural Language Processing but somehow switched to Front End Web Dev in the end. Hence, I halted learning Python and started doing research on Front End learning path. This phase actually lasted for nearly a month due to me either chasing rabbits or trying different courses/materials before settling down on freeCodeCamp, Codeacademy and Colt Steele's course, and Google LOL.

Can't forget to mention my idol Andrei Neagoie (Colt Steele is still King, and Andrei is Prince if you know what I mean):

For resources, I found these curated list by Krishna Kakade extremely useful:<br>

<br><em>Project 2</em> IELTS website

### Day 3
Helped a friend with article translation so didn't have much time for coding. Learnt Git and GitHub.<br>
Markdown cheatsheet: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

### Day 4 + 5
Debugged the website from Day 2. Still haven't figured out how to remove the white spaces between divs. I guess I'll get back to it later.

### Day 6 + 7
Bought Complete Web development Bootcamp by Angela Yu whom I cannot reccommend highly enought. I'm a visual learner so in love with her teaching materials.

Learned Advanced JS and DOM
